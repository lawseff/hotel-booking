# Hotel Booking

#### Disclaimer:
If you somehow managed to find this repo, don't browse the code.

Why?
1) This is legacy code 
and I'm not really interested in supporting this project
2) It has zero budget
3) A couple of features gotta be made in short deadlines

## Business use case

A **client** fills out an **application**, specifying the number of beds, room class and the length of stay.
The administrator:

- manages clients and rooms;
- views received applications;
- selects the most suitable and available room for the client;
- bills the client.
